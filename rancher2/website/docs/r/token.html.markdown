# rancher2\_token

Provides a Rancher v2 Token resource. This can be used to create Tokens for Rancher v2 provider user and retrieve their information.

There are 2 kind of tokens:
- no scoped: valid for global system.
- scoped: valid for just a specific cluster (`cluster_id` should be provided).

Tokens can't be updated once created. Any diff in token data will recreate the token. If any token expire, Rancher2 provider will generate a diff to regenerate it.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new rancher2 Token
resource "rancher2_token" "foo" {
  description = "foo token"
  ttl = 1200
}
# Create a new rancher2 Token scoped
resource "rancher2_token" "foo" {
  cluster_id = "<cluster-id>"
  description = "foo token"
  ttl = 1200
}
```

* `cluster_id` - (Optional/ForceNew) Cluster ID for scoped token (string)
